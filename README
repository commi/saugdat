Usage
-----
Before you can use it you need to get your environment up and running
and install some packages via pip. I used a virtual environment for
that (requires you to install virtualenv on your computer)

1. virtualenv -p python3 ~/.virtualenvs/saugdat/
2. source ~/.virtualenvs/saugdat/bin/activate
3. pip install requests bs4
4. chmod +x saugdat
5. ./saugdat > urls.txt
